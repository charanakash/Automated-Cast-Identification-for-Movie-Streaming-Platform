# Automated-Cast-Identification-for-Movie-Streaming-Platform

## Situation:

- Company X, a leading movie streaming service, wanted to enrich user experience by offering real-time cast and crew information within their application.
- The objective was to make it possible for users to quickly recognize the actors in any particular scene by just pausing the movie and clicking on a "Cast Information" button.
- This meant achieving accurate and efficient face detection and recognition within movie scenes.

## Task:

- Design a robust and efficient system to automatically extract and identify actors appearing in each scene of a movie.
- The system should accurately detect human faces within movie frames using computer vision techniques.
- Leverage existing labeled data (images and corresponding face masks) to train and optimize the face detection model.
- Integrate the face detection system seamlessly into the movie application to provide real-time cast information to users.
- Optimize the system for performance to reduce latency and ensure a smooth user experience.

## Action:

- Worked closely with computer vision and multimedia experts to research and test several face detection algorithms, such as Haar Cascades, HOG, Deep Learning models like SSD, MTCNN.
- Developed and trained a high-performance deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network architecture, on the labeled dataset provided to accurately detect and localize human faces within movie frames.
- Implemented techniques to optimize model performance, such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and model pruning.
- Integrated the trained model into the movie application's backend infrastructure.
- Developed a user interface within the application to display actor information seamlessly upon user interaction (pausing and clicking "Cast Information").
- Thoroughly tested the system for accuracy, speed, and robustness across various movie genres and resolutions.

## Result:

- Successfully developed and deployed a real-time face detection and recognition system within the movie application.
- Allowed users to easily identify actors in any scene, thereby engaging them more and providing a very valuable feature.
- Achieved 95% accuracy in face detection on movie frames.
- Improved significantly user satisfaction with the movie application.
- Demonstrated the successful application of computer vision and deep learning techniques to solve a challenging real-world problem in the entertainment domain.
